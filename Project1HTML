                <h3>Business vs Security</h3>
                <h4>security, cybersecurity, business, decision-making</h4>
                <p>The final say on security is always a tough challenge to overcome. The business focuses on profit which would clearly indicate they would
                   want less overhead and spending while the security department would spend vast amounts of money in order to keep everything confidential,
                   the integrity intact, and accessible to the proper audience at all times. The ultimate responsibility for product security lies with the
                   business, as it is their product and reputation on the line. However, the security department should have a significant say in product
                   security decisions, as they are the experts in the field. Higher security is always good to have, but it can be costly and
                   restrict the ability of other employees to do their work which cuts into profits. It will always come down to compromise and balance. In case
                   of any conflict between the business and the security department on product security decisions, a neutral third party can help to mediate and
                   find a compromise. The goal should be to balance the business's need to bring products to market quickly with the security department's goal
                   of ensuring product security.

                <h3>You just got hacked. Should you pay?</h3>
                <h4>Ransomware, Hacking, Business</h4>
                <p>
                    You just got hacked, infected, locked out of your system. The criminals are demanding 
                    you pay the ransom they want, and pinkie promise they will give you your data back. 
                    What do you do? The answer is murky at best, however, it is highly discouraged. There
                    is no guarantee that they will give the key to decrypt the data when you pay, it encourages 
                    further Ransomware attacks now that they know you are susceptible and willing to pay.
                    The best option is to have a proper defense in place to prevent this from happening in the 
                    first place, and also have a robust backup and recovery system in place to minimize the impact.
                    They will still have control of your data to share as they please, however, you will still 
                    have access to your system. The organization gets to decide whether or not they want to 
                    pay ultimately, but they need to weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of doing so. They
                    should always start with and prioritize prevention, preparation, and response for their critical 
                    assets and operations.
